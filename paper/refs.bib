   abstract = {To route and schedule trains over a large complex network can be computationally intensive. One way to reduce complexity could be to ''aggregate" suitable sections of a network. In this paper, we present a simulation-based technique to generate delay estimates over track segments as a function of traffic conditions, as well as network topology. We test our technique by comparing the delay estimates obtained for a network in Los Angeles with the delays obtained from the simulation model developed by Lu et al. [Lu, Q., Dess-ouky, M.M., Leachman, R.C., 2004. Modeling of train movements through complex networks. ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation 14, 48-75], which has been shown to be representative of the real-world delay values. Railway dispatchers could route and schedule freight trains over large networks by using our technique to estimate delay across aggregated network sections.},

   abstract = {Class 1 railroads are expected to face increasing capacity constraints due to long-term projections of growth in both freight and passenger traffic. To prepare for this growth and to strategically determine the best capacity expansion projects the Class 1 railroads make extensive use of a simulation tool known as Rail Traffic Controller (RTC). This tool can be used to estimate the capacity of existing or propose track and signal configurations. One of the primary outputs of these analyses are estimates of train delay. Delay is the extra time it takes a train to operate on a route due to conflicts with other traffic. Reduction in delay is often used by the railroads to calculate the benefit of a project or operational change. However the specific factors that cause these delays are not well understood. We used RTC to categorize and quantify the delay due to different types of conflicts and operational causes. The conflicts considered were meets, passes, mainline restrictions and entry delay. The operational causes considered were the delays due to acceleration, braking, reduced speed and dwell time. The results were studied for trends and offer a better understanding of the principal factors that contribute to train delay. With delay being used as the primary metric to select projects, understanding the leading causes of delay is important to plan capacity more effectively and economically. This work provides insight into the outputs railroads use for their decision making and potentially allows planners to more effectively choose specific alternatives that will provide the greatest benefit.},

   abstract = {Railway operations are vulnerable to delays. Accurate predictions of train arrival and departure delays improve the passenger service quality and are essential for real-time railway traffic management to minimise their further spreading. This review provides a synoptic overview and discussion covering the breadth of diverse approaches to predict train delays. We first categorise research contributions based on their underlying modelling paradigm (data-driven and event-driven) and their mathematical model. We then distinguish between very short to long-term predictions and classify different input data sources that have been considered in the literature. We further discuss advantages and disadvantages of producing deterministic versus stochastic predictions, the applicability of different approaches during disruptions and their interpretability. By comparing the results of the included contributions, we can indicate that the prediction error generally increases when broadening the prediction horizon. We find that data-driven approaches might have the edge on event-driven approaches in terms of prediction accuracy, whereas event-driven approaches that explicitly model the dynamics and dependencies of railway traffic have their strength in providing interpretable predictions, and are more robust concerning disruption scenarios. The growing availability of railway operations data is expected to increase the appeal of big-data and machine learning methods.},

abstract="Centrality is a key property of complex networks that influences the behavior of dynamical processes, like synchronization and epidemic spreading, and can bring important information about the organization of complex systems, like our brain and society. There are many metrics to quantify the node centrality in networks. Here, we review the main centrality measures and discuss their main features and limitations. The influence of network centrality on epidemic spreading and synchronization is also pointed out in this chapter. Moreover, we present the application of centrality measures to understand the function of complex systems, including biological and cortical networks. Finally, we discuss some perspectives and challenges to generalize centrality measures for multilayer and temporal networks.",
